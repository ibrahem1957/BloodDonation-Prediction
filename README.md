# Blood Donation

This project focuses on analyzing blood donation data and building machine learning models to predict donor eligibility based on health and demographic features.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore blood donation patterns, clean the dataset, visualize key insights, and apply multiple machine learning models to classify whether a donor is **Eligible** or **Not Eligible**.

The project also includes evaluation metrics and prediction on new donor data.
